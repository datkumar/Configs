## Installing Android Studio

The most convenient way to install and manage JetBrains IDEs like Android Studio, IntelliJ is via their [**JetBrains Toolbox**](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) app. It makes it easier to update/downgrade versions of your various JetBrains IDEs as well as see all your projects for those IDEs in one place

- Download the Toolbox tarball (`.tar.gz`) for Linux from their downloads. It contains the `jetbrains-toolbox` AppImage file. Extract contents of the tarball into `~/Applications` folder:

  ```sh
  # Create the Applications folder if it doesn't exist
  mkdir -p ~/Applications
  # Extract contents (AppImage) from tarball and copy to that folder
  tar xf ~/Downloads/jetbrains-toolbox*.tar.gz -C ~/Applications
  ```

- Go to the `~/Applications` folder from File Explorer. Double click on the `jetbrains-toolbox` AppImage file. Accept terms and select `Android Studio` to install. It should automatically download, install, configure Android Studio IDE as well as create a Desktop entry. The JetBrains Toolbox app installs IDEs in the `~/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/` folder

- The wizard will install: **Android SDK**, **Android Platform**, Android Virtual Device (**AVD**)

  - The Android SDK is installed within `~/Android/Sdk/` folder
  - By default, Android Studio stores all user settings in `~/.config/Google/AndroidStudio2023.3/` and uses `~/.local/share/Google/AndroidStudio2023.3/` for cache data

- Install the `Dart` and `Flutter` plugins available for Android Studio and restart the IDE

- If you wish to be able to launch Android Studio from terminal via `studio` as well as the platform tools like `adb`, `fastboot` etc., add them to your `PATH` in the Shell profile file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

  ```sh
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/android-studio/bin
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Android/Sdk/platform-tools
  ```

  After saving, restart your Shell to load changes: `exec $(which $SHELL)`

## Installing Flutter

Following the official [Flutter Linux installation docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux/android):

- Install the [`Flutter`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) extension in VSCode. It will prompt you to locate the Flutter SDK. Since you don't have an existing Flutter SDK, select `Download SDK`. You can set the install location to something like `~/FlutterSdk`

- Now, the latest Flutter SDK will be downloaded into `~/FlutterSdk/flutter/` folder.

  - If you want a specific Flutter SDK version, you'll have to download it from their [SDK Archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive) and extract it into desired location via `tar -cJf ~/Downloads/flutter_linux*.tar.xz YOUR_LOCATION`

- Add the location of **Flutter SDK's binaries** (like `flutter`, `dart`) to your `PATH` by adding these lines in your Shell config file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

  ```sh
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/FlutterSdk/flutter/bin
  ```

  Now restart your shell: `exec $(which $SHELL)`

- Install the **Linux toolchain** packages:

  ```sh
  # For Ubuntu/Debian (apt):
  sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y;
  sudo apt-get install -y curl git zip unzip xz-utils \
    clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libglu1-mesa \
    libc6:amd64 libstdc++6:amd64 libbz2-1.0:amd64 libncurses5:amd64


  # Equivalent packages for Fedora (dnf):
  sudo dnf up -y
  sudo dnf install -y curl git zip unzip xz-devel \
    clang cmake ninja-build pkgconf-pkg-config gtk3-devel mesa-libGLU \
    glibc libstdc++ bzip2-libs ncurses-libs
  ```

- Install the **latest Android `cmdline-tools`**:

  - Open Android Studio
  - In the `New Project` startup, select `More Actions` > `SDK Manager` > `Android SDK` > `SDK Tools` > `Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)`
  - Hit `Apply`

- Accept **Android licenses**:

  ```sh
  # Enter `y` to agree for each prompt
  flutter doctor --android-licenses
  ```

- Disable analytics (optional):

  ```sh
  flutter config --disable-analytics
  dart --disable-analytics
  ```

- Finally, check the `flutter doctor -v` output. It should contain all tickmarks and look like:

## Enable VM acceleration (optional but recommended)

Linux-based systems support virtual machine acceleration via **KVM** (Kernel-based VM) package. Referring the official Android Developer docs to [Configure hardware acceleration for the Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration?utm_source=android-studio)

The [Configure VM acceleration on Linux](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration?utm_source=android-studio#vm-linux) section on the only mentions how to do it for Ubuntu/Debian based distros. You can also refer Ubuntu's [KVM installation docs](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation)

However, for **Fedora** in my case, I'm referring the [Fedora Quick Docs page for Virtualization](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/virtualization-getting-started/):

- Check that your CPU supports virtualization:

  ```sh
  # Check "Virtualization" section of output. Mine said "AMD-V"
  lscpu
  # It should print a bunch of flags
  grep -E '^flags.*(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
  ```

- View available packages in the `virtualization` package group:

  ```sh
  dnf groupinfo virtualization
  ```

  It's output would contain:

  ```txt
  Group: Virtualization
  Description: These packages provide a graphical virtualization environment.
  Mandatory Packages:
    virt-install
  Default Packages:
    libvirt-daemon-config-network
    libvirt-daemon-kvm
    qemu-kvm
    virt-manager
    virt-viewer
  Optional Packages:
    guestfs-tools
    python3-libguestfs
    virt-top
  ```

- To install the mandatory, default, and optional packages:

  ```sh
  sudo dnf group install --with-optional virtualization
  ```

- Start and enable the `libvirtd` service to load on boot:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start libvirtd
  sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
  ```

- Verify that the KVM kernel modules are properly loaded:

  ```sh
  lsmod | grep kvm
  ```

## Upgrading Flutter

Referring the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/upgrade):

```sh
# Upgrading Flutter SDK
flutter upgrade

# Identify out-of-date package dependencies and get advice on updating them
flutter pub outdated

# Update to the latest compatible versions of all the dependencies in pubspec.yaml
flutter pub upgrade
```
